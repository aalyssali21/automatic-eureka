Cloud Business Insight Report from NLP algorithms

NLP algorithms powered in the business insights of Cloud computing from social media posts and financial annual reports.

Why do I want to do NLP algorithms for cloud computing?
The three biggest cloud business players are AWS from Amazon, Azure from Microsoft, and GCP from Google. NLP algorithms extract some common and unique features related to the cloud computing business for these three players. 

Why do I use annual reports and tweeter as data sources?
The annual report reflects how the company self-evaluates its whole business, and cloud tweets show how the public sees these players' cloud services.
In annual reports, the cloud business is mentioned as a part of the whole corporate strategy. And the frequency of cloud keywords can show how important cloud business is in their current development stage and its role in long-term strategy. Some keywords mentioned by each company could be some differentiators for developing cloud business in the mid-term or long-term. In cloud tweets related to these three companies, we saw more insights about which areas individuals or general people mention about the clouding players, which helps grab more depth analysis.
